# Placeholder Images

The following images need to be replaced with actual assets:

1. **screenshot-1.png** - Project screenshot (800x450px recommended, 16:9 aspect ratio)
2. **screenshot-2.png** - Project screenshot (800x450px recommended, 16:9 aspect ratio)

You can create these using:
- Online placeholder services like [placeholder.com](https://placeholder.com/)
- Image editing software
- Stock photos from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)

For now, these are referenced in the project cards but will need to be added to the `/public` directory.
